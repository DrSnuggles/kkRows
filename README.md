# kkRows

## Goal
Display 1 million rows in the browser with search.

There is also another repository "hyperlist" which does similar.

Difference is that here workers are used and it's event based instead rAF.

The million rows with 26 cols eats up about 745MB inside the worker.

## License
This was just a test. Feel free to get inspired ;)
